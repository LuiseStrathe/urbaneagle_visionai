About the notebooks in this folder:
-----------------------------------

SEGMENTATION MODEL
--Training--
The segmentation model was trained (finetuning of U-ResNet50) in a Notebook in Google Colab.
A notebook copy can be found as "train_segmentation.ipynb".

IDENTIFICATION MODEL
--approach (info)--
These notebooks do not show the final training of the tree identification.
Yet, they show the steps and analysis that resulted in the model now implemented
 in "src" to identify areas in an image with a tree in it.
 See "Base_Model_[].ipynb" - the notebooks sequentially evolve from each other.

 POSITIONING MODEL 
 --TRAINING--
The positioning model was trained in NOTEBOOK "Base_Model_06.ipynb"
